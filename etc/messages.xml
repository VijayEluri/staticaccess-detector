<p>This detector looks checks if methods annotated with <code>@StaticIndependent</code> do not read or write static state,
that is, static variables which are not final and immutable (like a String or Integer). Any methods called from
a <code>@StaticIndependent</code> method are also implicitly assumed to be annotated, and thus, checked for static access.

This method is annotated with <code>@StaticIndependent</code> (or is implicitly annotated as it is called from an
annotated method), and it attempts to read or write a static variable, which isn't final and immutable.
